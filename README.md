# MACE_Lindblad_master_eqn_numerics_3D_gas_interacting_driven_atoms_2_level
 Numerically solves the Moving Average Cluster Expansion (MACE), also known as cluster-mean-field, equations of motion with arbitrary cluster size to dynamically evolve a driven 3D gas of 2 level atoms interacting via dipolar interactions with correlated dissipation
