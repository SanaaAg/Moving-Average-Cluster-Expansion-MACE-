# Cluster_mean_field_Lindblad_master_eqn_numerics_3D_gas_interacting_driven_atoms_2_level
 Numerically solves the cluster-mean-field equations of motion with arbitrary cluster size to dynamically evolve a driven 3D gas of 2 level atoms interacting via dipolar interactions with correlated dissipation
